The text that we were working with was the scholia to the Venetus A manuscript of the Iliad. These scholia are scholarly footnotes which comment on various aspects of the Iliadic text. Because the Venetus A is the oldest complete manuscript of the Iliad, these scholia are especially significant to the history of Homeric scholarship. For this manuscript is not just old, but also replete with scholia, many of which have never been fully published. Furthermore, there are five distinct zones in which scholia can occur: Main, intermarginal, interior, interlinear, and exterior.
